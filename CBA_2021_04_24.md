21. Click on Finish:   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/DeviceDriverComplete.png)
22. For the driver notice that the readme.txt says "To install the driver, run stlink_winusb_install.bat in administrator mode, before connecting any ST-Link to the PC." So run the stlink_winusb_install batch file:

23. Proceed with the device driver installation Next >   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/DeviceDriverWelcome.png)
24. Confirm that you would like to install the device software:   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/WindowsSecurityUSB.png)
25. Click on Finish:   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/DeviceDriverComplete.png)
26. Download the [STM32duino drivers](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/):   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/DriversDownload.png)
27. Extract the download:   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/ExtractDownload.png)
28. Keep the download:   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/KeepDownload.png)
29. Install the drivers:   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/InstallDrivers.png)
30. Press any key to continue . . .    (Some patience is needed with install_drivers.bat for the Maple DFU)   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/DFUdriver.png)
31. Install the COM driver:   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/InstallCOMDrivers.png)
32. Press any key to continue . . .    
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/STMdriver.png)
33. In Arduino IDE you can find the STM32 boards package in the "Board" menu. Select the desired boards series:   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/BoardsSTM32F1xx.png)
34. Select Tools -> Upload methods -> STLink Depending of the board, several upload methods could be proposed, thanks the "Tools > Upload Method" menu.   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/UploadMethod.png)   
35. Connect the ST LINK V2 or similar to the board. Then plug the ST LINK V2 or similar into the computer.   
    ![](CBA_2021_04_24.jpg)
    On a generic blue pill (note that the pinouts on ST LINK V2 clones are not all the same):   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/ceng317/master/images/stm32f103c8t6.jpg)   
37. Select the blink example:   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/SelectBlinkExample.png)
38. If it says ```LED_BUILTIN```, that should work since it is mapped to ```PC13```   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/13noPC.png)
39. If it appears with code to blink pin ```13```, we'll need to specify that it is on Port C by adding PC in front of the 13:   
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/AddPCto13.png)
40. Click on upload:    
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/six0four/ceng317/img/Upload.png)
41. If sucessfully uploaded the application should start and the green LED should blink at the rate controlled by the code.

42. This STM32F103 microcontroller based platform
provides a Serial Peripheral
Interface (SPI) for an onboard OLED and SDcard socket, a one wire
DS18B20 temperature sensor, redundant Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)
LM75 temperature, BME280 environment, W25Q64JVDAIM flash
and PCF8574 I/O expansion chips, a segmented and other indicator LEDs,
an analog joystick, battery and a connector for a servo. As such the plan is for this document to provide more examples in the future, ideally to easily test the OLED.
43. This platform is deprecated due to STM32 shortages and OLED reliability issues. We have moved to a RP2040 platform.
44. Both BOOT jumpers are on the 0 side (versus 1).   
[On very rare occasions uploading fails. In this situation I have to move BOOT0 jumper to 1 and upload the sketch. Binaries do not run when BOOT0 is set to 1 therefore I move it back. There are also very rare occasions when blue pill does not reset after upload. I have to push the reset button.](https://www.onetransistor.eu/2017/11/stm32-bluepill-arduino-ide.html)
